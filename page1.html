    Virtual Machine is a completely separate individual operating system installed on your usual operating system. it is implemented by software emulation and hardware virtualization.
Virtualization technologies continue to grow and become more important in modern data centres. In today's data centre, virtualization is a standard every IT department has moved to. It is becoming an extremely hot topic in IT as a way to consolidate servers and reduce IT budgets.
Virtualization is far from a new concept, but it has significantly evolved over the years. Today's virtual machines are really complete computers in their own right, running their own inside the context of another operating system, with their own RAM and disk space. The virtualisation software that makes this possible allocates this specific resources from the host computer for use on the virtual system. Other hardware is shared with the host operating system and with all other virtual machines that might be running on the device.

    Even when these devices are shared, the virtual machine's
    operating system such as Linux, Windows, NetWare etc still has software drivers to enable the devices, It's not a situation where you're running something crippled or incomplete. Also, while a virtual machine runs inside the context of an operating system and shares the host's hardware, the virtual machine is completely isolated from the host. So, we can see that it is also very highly secured.
With a plethora of applications and features available,
    Virtualization is all set to be the next best thing in the
    IT industry. With all the major companies in the market rushing to adopt this system while most have already done it for a while, Virtual Computer is one of the most interesting as well as important field of work.
